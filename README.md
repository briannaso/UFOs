<h1>UFO's </h1>
<h3>Project Overview: </h3> 
The purpose of this project is to create a website that sources all data on UFO's all over the world. The goal was to create a website that can be actively filtered search criteria to supply information on the specific UFO event. 

<h3>Results: </h3>
  
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
The search criteria provides five options to filter by: date, city, state, country and shape of the object.

  
<h3>Summary: </h3> 
Overall, the data provided gives a good summary of each event. The downside to the website is an inability to filter between a range of dates. This could be helpful in identifying patterns during specific times, seasons, years etc.  

Recommendations:
<ol>
  <li> Create a fitler for date ranges</li>
  <li> Provude more than one article on the main page for more resources </li> 
</ol>
