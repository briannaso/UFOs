<h1>UFO's </h1>
<h3>Project Overview: </h3> 
The purpose of this project is to create a website that sources all data on UFO's all over the world. The goal was to create a website that can be actively filtered search criteria to supply information on the specific UFO event. 

<h3>Results: </h3>
 The search criteria provides five options to filter by: 
 <li> Date </li>
 <li>  city</li>
 <li> state</li>
 <li> country </li>
 <li> shape</li>

<h3>Summary: </h3> 
Overall, the data provided gives a good summary of each event. The downside to the website is an inability to filter between a range of dates. This could be helpful in identifying patterns during specific times, seasons, years etc.  

Recommendations:
<ol>
  <li> Create a fitler for date ranges</li>
  <li> Provude more than one article on the main page for more resources </li> 
</ol>
